# WeWantWaste – Skip Size Selection Page Redesign

This is a front-end redesign of the “Choose Your Skip Size” page for [WeWantWaste](https://wewantwaste.co.uk/), built as part of a coding challenge. The goal was to give the page a fresh, modern look while keeping all of its original functionality in place.

## My Thought Process

The main focus was on improving the user experience and visual design without changing how the page works behind the scenes. Here’s what I aimed for:

- A clean, readable codebase built with React
- A smooth, responsive layout that works on all devices
- A clear and modern UI with accessible components
- Maintaining existing data fetching and functionality

---

## What’s Included

- A fully responsive layout (desktop + mobile)
- New visual design for the skip cards
- A custom stepper using Material UI for better UX
- Real-time data fetching from the provided API
- Tailwind CSS used for fast and flexible styling

## Tools I Used

- **React** (with Create React App)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Material UI (MUI)** for the stepper component
